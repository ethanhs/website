Hi! My name is Ethan and I am a passionate open source developer living in Berkeley, CA. I love studying compilers, programming languages, type systems, and on occaison electronic gadgets.

I started learning to program when I was a Sophmore in high school, when I taught myself Python 2. Since then, I've been learning more about programming languages, both their designs and implementations. My current interests are in Python, Rust, JITs, type systems and quantum computers! I also enjoy tinkering with microcontrollers and Raspberry Pis.

In my open source work, I am a core developer on the mypy project, and a contributor to CPython, focusing on porting Python to the web.

I currently work at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab [BQSKit](https://github.com/bqsKit/bqskit), a toolkit for optimizing quantum programs for quantum computers. In my free time I like to work on open source projects and play Minecraft.
