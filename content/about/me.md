Hi! My name is Ethan Smith and I am a passionate open source developer living in Berkeley, CA. I love studying compilers, programming languages, type systems, and on occaison electronic gadgets.

I started learning to program when I was a Sophmore in high school, when I taught myself Python 2. Since then, I've been learning more about programming languages, both their designs and implementations. My current interests are in Python, Rust, JITs, type systems and more! I also enjoy tinkering with microcontrollers and Raspberry Pis.

In my open source work, I am a core developer on the mypy project, and a contributor to CPython.

I currently am a Senior at UC Berkeley, studying Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. I am an active member of the SF Python community, and am Site Manager at the Open Compute Facility, a UC Berkeley student group.
