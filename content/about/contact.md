There are several ways to contact me.
## e-mail

If you prefer email, you can contact me at the address below:

<a href="mailto:ethan@ethanhs.me"></a>

## gitter.im

I can also be reached frequently on Gitter chat, as I am often online. Requires Github, Gitlab, or Twitter account.

## twitter

I am `@ethanhs`. I check Twitter several times a day, so this is a good place to reach me, if nothing else works.

## irc

I am infrequently on freenode IRC as ethanhs. If you want to chat and don't want to use Gitter, contact me through email or Twitter.
